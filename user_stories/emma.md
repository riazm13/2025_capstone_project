ðŸ§­ Story & Context
Emma plays a crucial role in the bankâ€™s risk management and regulatory compliance operations. With increasing scrutiny from regulators and the growing complexity of financial crimes, her job is to monitor transaction data, enforce AML (Anti-Money Laundering) protocols, and ensure the bank complies with KYC (Know Your Customer) standards.

She often collaborates with internal audit teams, legal advisors, and technology teams to assess risks and respond quickly to alerts or audits. Emma also helps create internal reports for the Bank of Ghana and other financial regulatory bodies.

Her decisions carry weightâ€”missing a red flag could expose the bank to legal, reputational, and financial risks, while being too rigid could create friction for legitimate customers.

âœ… Needs & Goals from the Dashboard:
Emma needs a real-time compliance dashboard that allows her to monitor activity across the bank and quickly identify anomalies, risky profiles, or regulatory gaps. The system should allow for both alerts and detailed drill-downs for investigations.

Her goals include:

Identifying and investigating suspicious or illegal financial activities

Maintaining compliance with evolving AML/KYC regulations

Minimizing the bank's exposure to fraud and fines

Ensuring that the onboarding process is both compliant and efficient

Generating audit-ready reports at short notice
